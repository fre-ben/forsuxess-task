## Task

The task was to code an importer, which reads and parses XML-files containing jobdata.
Specific data inside these XML-files should then be extracted and formatted, in order to display it in frontend afterwards.

## Prerequisites
In order to display the data from the corresponding MongoDB, a `.env` file containing access information is needed.

## Getting Started
First, install all dependencies and then run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
